# Repository

Designs beautiful websites for your repositories and allow you to personalize them easily. See [an example with my own library](/franciscop/superdom):

![Responsive design](/docs/responsive.png)

You will get all of the files in your repository's /docs (standard place to publish websites) and a webhook attached that will recompile everything when your README.md or documentation.md change.
