# Repository

Designs beautiful websites for your repositories and allow you to personalize them easily. See [an example with my own library](/franciscop/superdom):

![Responsive design](docs/responsive.png)

You will get all of the files in your repository's `/docs` (standard place to publish websites) and a webhook attached that will recompile everything when your `README.md` or `documentation.md` change.



## Pricing

The website builder is free for everyone to use for one repository, but if you want advanced features or several repositories we're asking for some investment:


<div class="price">

    <tr>

      <th><h3>Pro</h3></th>
      <th><h3>Enterprise</h3></th>

      <td><strong>5</strong> repositories</td>
      <td><strong>100</strong> repositories</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Auto deploy</td>
