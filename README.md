# Repository

Designs beautiful websites for your repositories and allow you to personalize them easily. See [an example with my own library](/franciscop/superdom):

![Responsive design](docs/responsive.png)

You will get all of the files in your repository's `/docs` (standard place to publish websites) and a webhook attached that will recompile everything when your `README.md` or `documentation.md` change.


## Pricing

The website builder is free for everyone to use for one repository, but if you want advanced features or several repositories we're asking for some investment:

<div class="flex two three-600">
  <div>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p><strong>1</strong> repository</p>
    <p>Auto deploy</p>
    <p>-</p>
    <p><strong>Free</strong></p>
    <p><a class="button" href="/#hero">Use for free</a></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Pro</h2>
    <p><strong>5</strong> repositories</p>
    <p>Auto deploy & update</p>
    <p>Github issues</p>
    <p><strong>5$ / month</strong></p>
    <p><a class="button">Buy with Paypal</a></p>
    <p>Cancel any time</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Enterprise</h2>
    <p><strong>100</strong> repositories</p>
    <p>Auto deploy & update</p>
    <p>Email support</p>
    <p><strong>100$ / month</strong></p>
    <p><a class="button">Buy with Paypal</a></p>
    <p>Cancel any time</p>
  </div>
</div>
